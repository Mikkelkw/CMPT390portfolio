## Highlighted projects

### 1. Algortihm Visualizer (https://github.com/Mikkelkw/algorithms_visualizer)
This assignment is a collection of sorting and pathfinding algorithms. The reason I wanted to highlight this project is because it demonstrates my skills as a software developer. In this project I was able to implement a multitude of frameworks and languages I knew well, but had not worked on a project of this scale in. In addition to visualizers, this application also contains an authentication process with a SQL database for the backend. 
The assignment helped me accomplish two of the programs main learning goals:
•	To understand the components of a contemporary computer system.
•	To provide a background in software development and project management.

### 2. Space Game (https://github.com/Mikkelkw/SpaceGame)
The Space Game was a nifty assignment completed in the data structures course. The reason I want to highlight this game is because it was my first deep dive into software engineering. The game is a java implementation of an arcade game. In the game you play as a 2D spaceship flying around trying to destroy asteroid. The reason this game was so valuable for me was because it gave me instant feedback on my programming. It is also very visually appealing which is also a bonus in Computer Science. This was also one of my more software engineering focused projects. It helped me accomplish the same learning goals as above.
•	To understand the components of a contemporary computer system.
•	To provide a background in software development and project management.
But in a different manner

### 3. GoPro Marketing Project (adding soon)
During my Sophomore year, I was tasked with creating a marketing plan for a chosen company over a 5 years timeline. My group chose GoPro, a company making high-end action cameras. GoPro was the market leader for a few years. However, they quickly got overtaken by similar companies offering cameras with the same features but prices significantly lower. Struggling to innovate in a very niche area of multimedia, GoPro’s sales have been declining for years. 
My group decided to completely switch the target buyers/users of these cameras. Instead of solely focusing on action, we decided to make the cameras part of the average Joe’s everyday life. The camera would be a user and family friendly vlog type of camera. We redesigned their ad removing all extreme sport and electro/house music to only show daily life shots with a popular pop song.

I wanted to highlight this project as it shows my skills are not limited to programming. The learning goals achieved in this project was • Develop an understanding of a basic business environment.
•	Understand concepts and processes for achieving organizational goals with
information technology.

### 4. Valuation Essay: How do firms value assets? (https://github.com/Mikkelkw/valuation_essay)
This project is an extensive essay exploring how you would go about valuing assets in todays day and age. The paper takes an indepth look at valuation models, factors and specific variables used as a basis for our conclusions. The reason I chose this project is because it demonstrates a deep understanding of financial modeling and evaluation. This unique perspective is what laid the foundation of my interest in finance. The learning goals applied in this project is:
• Develop an understanding of a basic business environment.
•	Understand concepts and processes for achieving organizational goals with
information technology.

### 5. Math Game (https://github.com/Mikkelkw/Math_game)
This is a Unity created project with scripting done in C#. The scope of this project was to create a math game for kids using our chosen technology. We used Unity to implement our game functionalities. The game gave me a different perspective of programming as the visual feedback was unmatched compared to anything I had ever seen before. The learning goals applied in this project was 
• To understand the components of a contemporary computer system.
• To provide a background in software development and project management.
• To understand concepts and processes for achieving organizational goals with
information technology.
